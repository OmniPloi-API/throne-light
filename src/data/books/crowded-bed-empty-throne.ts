  dedication: [
    `To every woman across cultures and generations, past, present, and rising. To the ones who endured, to the ones who resisted, and to the ones still searching for the throne within.`,
    `You are not an accessory to appetite. You are not a placeholder in a crowded bed. You are a sovereign seat, a divine decree, a royal house in motion.`,
    `Purpose preceded your presence; design defined your worth before desire ever arrived. You were not made to be chosen by rotation but revealed by destiny.`,
    `This book is for the sisters beside us, the mothers who came before us, and the daughters yet unborn.`,
    `You are not waiting to be chosen. You are called to reign.`,

  acknowledgments: [
    `First, I acknowledge God, the Author before every author, the Voice that called me, the Light that never let me dim. From my earliest years, His conviction burned in me like fire. He wove into my spirit a divine DNA of boldness, bravery, and courage and a royal signature that no culture, no critic, no circumstance could erase.`,
    `It is this light that astonished others, but it is this same light that steadied me. Without His inspiration, this book would not exist. Without His courage moving through me, I would not have dared to name what women have been told to hide.`,
    `To every page, every revelation, every decree, He is the Source, the breath, and the seal.`,
    `And to my grandmother: God chose to bring Jesus to earth through the lineage of Abraham, and in his sovereign design, he chose to bring me through your lineage. You were the originator of the bloodline that carried the generational warrior that I am. I am here because you endured, because you prayed, because you lived. You are the root of the crown I rise to carry.`,
    `And to the descendants who will come through me: this acknowledgment is also yours. To the little girl 100 years from now who will open this book and discover the words her great(x10) grandmother Eolles wrote, know this: your crown was written into you before the world named you. You are my proof that the warrior line lives on.`,

  aboutAuthor: [
    `Eolles was born with a divine DNA of boldness, bravery, and courage. A generational warrior entrusted with a voice that refuses silence. From her earliest years, she carried the fire of conviction and the light that astonished others even as it steadied her path.`,
    `Her calling is clear: to dismantle the lies that have imprisoned women, and to restore covenant, dignity, and throne partnership where appetite and rotation once ruled. She does not write as a theorist but as one entrusted with revelation, translating heaven's policy into words that free, crown, and call women to reign.`,
    `Through The Crowded Bed & The Empty Throne, Eolles stands in her ancestral seat, writing not only for the women of today and tomorrow, but also for the women who came before, mothers and grandmothers who still live under cultural and spiritual programming that can be broken even now. Her words are a bridge: forward for daughters yet unborn, and back toward the women whose courage carried us here.`,
    `She is more than an author; she is a sovereign voice, a house-builder, and a light-bearer whose work carries both weight and witness. Yet at the core of every assignment, Eolles remains what she has always been: a woman seated where heaven seats her, devoted to God, carrying revelation for a generation.`,

  manifesto: [
    `She gave her body, her loyalty, her silence. She bent, stayed, performed, endured, hoping he would finally see her. But he didn't. Because a man is not loyal to what you do. He is loyal to what aligns with who he believes he is becoming. So, this book was born. To remind her that the throne is never earned through service. That no amount of cooking, pleasing, or praying can make a man crown you if his soul never saw you as part of his kingdom.`,
    `The crowded bed is not full of lovers. It is full of lost women who believed effort secures elevation. Who gave their all in exchange for crumbs. Who mistook appreciation for allegiance. Desire for devotion. Chemistry for covenant. But this is her awakening. She has stopped auditioning. Stopped shrinking to be chosen. Stopped confusing consistency with clarity. She no longer begs to be crowned. She walks like she already is.`,
    `She is not moved by attention. She listens for alignment. She does not feed egos, she exposes them. She does not need to be loud; her silence speaks in tongues. Her presence calls forth the man. Not the boy. Not the addict. Not the imposter. But the King sleeping beneath performance.`,
    `She is not here for the bed. She is the throne. And the man who is ready will not try to possess her. He will prepare for her. Because the Queen is not sent to comfort his confusion. She is sent to confront it. She does not seduce his body. She summons his vision. She does not chase chemistry. She carries covenant in her bones.`,
    `So let the bed stay crowded. Let the throne remain empty. Until the King is ready to rise, and crown what he cannot replace.`,
  ],

  foreword: [
    `Beloved, you did not stumble into this book. You were summoned. There are words that entertain, and there are words that awaken. This is not a book written to decorate your shelf. It is a decree to disturb the silence in your soul; the silence that has kept you in places too small for your crown.`,
    `Every page you are about to read is both mirror and weapon. A mirror, because it will expose the patterns we have been trained to repeat. A weapon, because it will cut through the illusions we have been conditioned to accept.`,
    `The world has taught women to measure worth by who desires them, who touches them, who calls at midnight. But desire is not devotion. Attention is not authority. And proximity to a man's body is not the same as partnership in his destiny.`,
    `This book is not for the woman content with comfort. It is for the woman who feels the ache of misalignment. The woman who knows she was created for more than crowded beds and casual invitations. It is for the woman who understands she was born with a throne inside her and refuses to live beneath it any longer.`,
    `The throne already exists. It is eternal. It is part of divine order, waiting for recognition and reverence. Too often, men leave it empty because kingship feels heavier than pleasure. Too often, women accept the bed because proximity feels safer than patience. But the throne is never absent. It is waiting. It is holy.`,
    `Here you will be confronted. Confronted with why men climb into beds but rarely honor thrones. Confronted with why women fight for access instead of demanding alignment. Confronted with the quiet places in you that have settled for less than kingdom order.`,
    `But here you will also be comforted. Because you are not alone in this reckoning. Across generations, across cultures, across continents, women are rising. Rising from mattresses of confusion. Rising from hidden places. Rising to reclaim their crowns.`,
    `And now, it is your turn. So, take a deep breath. Prepare your heart. Lay down every excuse and every disguise. This is your invitation, not just to read, but to rise.`,
    `Welcome to The Crowded Bed & The Empty Throne. Your crown is waiting.`,

      subtitle: 'The Bed is Crowded, But the Throne is Empty',
      epigraph: 'Why so many women are in his bed, but no one reigns beside him',
      content: [
        `She is adored, pursued, devoured. But never established. Never seated.`,
        `In a world that teaches women to confuse access with authority, many have mistaken the bed for the throne, affection for anointing. But proximity to a man's desire is not the same as alignment with his destiny.`,
        `He will share his body. He might even share his secrets. But that does not mean he shares his crown.`,
        `The modern woman has been deceived into believing that being chosen is the same as being elevated. But how many of us have been "chosen" … only to be hidden? Loved in the dark, but never honored in the light. She receives his nights, but not his name. She tastes his pleasures, but never his plans. He climbs into bed with her but builds a kingdom without her.`,
        `✦ The Harem is Full, But the Throne Room is Silent`,
        `Look closer. His bed is crowded, loud with moans, empty promises, and temporary fantasies. But his throne? Silent. Gathering dust.`,
        `No one is seated beside him. Not because no one is worthy, but because he has not built a throne that requires a queen.`,
        `He builds for pleasure, not for legacy.`,
        `The tragedy is not that women desire love. The tragedy is that we have been conditioned to accept just enough. Enough attention to keep us waiting, but never enough vision to let us reign.`,
        `We settle for being "the one he calls" instead of asking, "What is he building?" We master how to keep his interest, but never stop to discern if he is even throned.`,
        `Because a man without a throne will always overuse the bed. The bed is easy. It demands nothing: no order, no assignment, no alignment.`,
        `But a throne? A throne requires kingship. And kingship requires a woman who can stand beside him, not just lie beneath him.`,
        `✦ You Are Not a Placement: You Are a Position`,
        `To every woman who has been rotated in and out of a man's life, thinking it made her special:`,
        `You are not his rotation. You are a revelation.`,
        `If you are fighting for space in his bed, chances are he has not made room on his throne.`,
        `So, we must ask different questions:`,
        `Is this man ruling or just rotating?`,
        `Has he built structure in his house, or just piled pillows on his bed?`,
        `Has he built a throne, or is he only building moments?`,
        `Because a man aligned with his purpose cannot give himself to every woman. He is too focused to be careless. Too appointed to be scattered. Too throned to be entertained by lust.`,
        `✦ You Were Not Made for a Mattress`,
        `You were made for a mandate.`,
        `You are not merely sensual, you are sacred. You were not created to compete in his bed. You were fashioned to co-reign on his throne.`,
        `It is time to leave the crowded bed. To exit the cycle of almost-relationships, situationships, and secret keepings. To stop mistaking penetration for partnership. To stop confusing orgasm with ordination.`,
        `The man who has no throne is not the man you are called to crown.`,
        `Because when the throne is truly built… he will not just desire you he will discern you.`,
        `✦ End of Chapter Callout`,
        `"You were never meant to be one of many in his bed: you were meant to be the one beside his throne."`,

      subtitle: "Queens Don't Compete in the Harem of False Power",
      epigraph: 'Why women compete and why men misuse the bed',
      content: [
        `The harem has always been an illusion. From the palaces of old to the bedrooms of today, it was never about power, only performance.`,
        `A collection of women orbiting one man, each convinced she is closer than the rest. Each mistaking proximity for position.`,
        `But no matter how crowded the bed, the throne remains untouched.`,
        `✦ The Mirage of Power`,
        `When a woman enters the harem, she thinks she has won. She tells herself she is chosen, that her beauty or loyalty has elevated her above the others.`,
        `But the truth is, she has not been crowned. She has only been rotated.`,
        `Attention feels like power, but it is counterfeit. Access feels like authority, but it is hollow.`,
        `To be desired by a man who has no throne is not to be honored, it is to be distracted.`,
        `This is the false power of the harem: women fighting for a spotlight that was never meant to define them, all while the true seat of dominion sits empty.`,
        `✦ Scarcity: The Wound That Breeds Competition`,
        `Why do women fight for crumbs? Because they've been taught that crowns are scarce.`,
        `Scarcity whispers: "If he gives her attention, there will be none left for you."`,
        `Scarcity trains women to compare, to undercut, to settle.`,
        `This is why sisterhood shatters. Not because women cannot unite, but because women have been conditioned to believe they are rivals instead of rulers.`,
        `Instead of remembering we were born with thrones inside us, we chase scraps tossed from a distracted man's table.`,
        `✦ Sister Wounds: The Divide Among Queens`,
        `Generations have taught women to distrust one another.`,
        `A mother warns her daughter not to trust other women. A friend whispers that every woman is competition. A culture rewards the mistress, the seductress, the one who can outshine the rest, even if only for a moment.`,
        `But queens do not compete in the harem. Queens reclaim their feminine sovereignty, and in doing so, they heal the wound between sisters.`,
        `The victory of another woman does not threaten you it confirms what is possible for you.`,
        `When we heal the sister wound, we break the cycle of women weakening each other just to impress a man who has not yet risen to his throne.`,
        `✦ Why Men Misuse the Bed`,
        `The bed is a refuge for the man who fears the throne.`,
        `To rule requires responsibility. To choose one queen requires clarity.`,
        `But to lie with many requires nothing but appetite.`,
        `So he gathers women like trophies, mistaking quantity for confirmation, mistaking conquest for kingship.`,
        `And the women, conditioned by scarcity, accept this arrangement as if it proves their worth.`,
        `But a man who misuses the bed is not enlarging his kingdom, he is exposing his lack of one.`,
        `✦ The Sovereign Feminine`,
        `The true queen reclaims herself by refusing the harem.`,
        `She sees the illusion of false power for what it is and steps away. She no longer fights other women for scraps of attention. She no longer mistakes sex for sovereignty.`,
        `Her crown is not up for competition. Her throne cannot be shared. Her worth is not negotiable.`,
        `To reclaim the sovereign feminine is to stand in dignity, to heal the wound of scarcity, and to call men higher, not by begging, but by being.`,
        `🔥 Chapter Close`,
        `So let the harem stay full. Let the false power keep glittering.`,
        `But as for you Queen, rise above the illusion.`,
        `Because queens don't compete where there is no throne. And the harem can never crown what heaven has already chosen.`,

      subtitle: 'The Lie of Being "Chosen"',
      epigraph: "You're not chosen if you're just the favorite slave",
      content: [
        `The most dangerous place a woman can be is mistaking access for authority. He tells you you're "different." He calls you his "favorite." He swears no one else makes him feel the way you do.`,
        `And for a moment, you believe you've been chosen.`,
        `But being rotated to the front of the line is not the same as being crowned to sit on the throne.`,
        `You are not chosen if you are still enslaved to his appetite. You are not chosen if your place depends on your performance. You are not chosen if he hides you in the bed but refuses to present you in the kingdom.`,
        `✦ The Favorite Slave`,
        `A slave is praised for service but never given sovereignty. She may be the one he runs to when his spirit is tired, when his body is weak, when his ego needs stroking.`,
        `But the very fact that he can use you without elevating you proves you are not his queen.`,
        `Men will always be loyal, but not to beauty, not to performance, not even to consistency. A man is loyal to only one thing: his vision, his assignment, his throne.`,
        `If he has not made you part of that, you are not chosen. You are simply available.`,
        `✦ The Counterfeit of "Different"`,
        `The harem thrives on comparison.`,
        `One woman is told she's prettier. Another is told she's sexier. Another is told she's more loyal.`,
        `He builds his empire of distraction by convincing each one she is closer than the rest.`,
        `But queens do not measure their worth by being "better than." Queens know they are beyond comparison.`,
        `Being called "different" in a lineup of slaves is still slavery. True chosenness is never about outperforming other women. It is about alignment with destiny.`,
        `✦ Desire Is Not Devotion`,
        `From the outside, it looks like devotion: the late-night calls, the intensity of his attention, the passion in his pursuit.`,
        `But passion without purpose is just fire with no altar. And fire without an altar always burns out.`,
        `This is why desire can never define you.`,
        `Men desire many. Men share their secrets with some. But men only crown one and even then, only if he himself has risen to his throne.`,
        `A man may love your presence, but if he has no vision to anchor that love, it will remain shallow. He may enjoy your company, but without covenant, it is comfort, not calling.`,
        `✦ The Weight of True Chosenness`,
        `To be chosen is not to be entertained in the night but to be established in the day. To be chosen is not to be the one he hides with, but the one he builds with. To be chosen is not to be the strongest slave, but the only queen.`,
        `True chosenness costs him clarity. It costs him commitment. It costs him the courage to elevate one woman and release the rest.`,
        `Until that happens, you are not chosen. You are convenient.`,
        `✦ The Call to Queens`,
        `Beloved, do not confuse flattery for favor. Do not confuse access for authority. Do not confuse being called "different" for being crowned.`,
        `You are not his escape. You are not his comfort. You are not his secret. You are not his favorite distraction.`,
        `You are a throne partner. A destiny match. A sovereign queen.`,
        `And until you are honored as such, you must refuse the lie of being chosen.`,
        `🔥 Chapter Close`,
        `So let the harem fight for titles. Let them cling to the illusion of being "different."`,
        `But as for you, Queen, rise above it.`,

      subtitle: 'What Keeps You in the Bed?',
      epigraph: 'Trauma-bonding, fantasy, validation, and crumbs',
      content: [
        `The bed is not always filled by lust. Sometimes it is filled by wounds.`,
        `Many women do not stay because they love him. They stay because something in their brokenness agrees with something in his. The body becomes the meeting place of unhealed pain. And what feels like passion is often nothing more than trauma dressed as desire.`,
        `✦ Trauma-Bonding: When Pain Feels Like Love`,
        `Trauma creates appetites. It convinces you that chaos is chemistry. That dysfunction is destiny.`,
        `So you mistake his inconsistency for mystery. You confuse his cruelty for strength. You tell yourself the pain is proof that this connection must be real.`,
        `But trauma is not love. It is only the echo of your own wounds, tricking you into lying beside someone who was never built to cover you. And if he has no throne, then your trauma will keep you tied to a bed that was never meant to hold you.`,
        `✦ Fantasy: Loving Who He Isn't`,
        `The bed becomes a stage where fantasy performs.`,
        `You are not in love with the man beside you. You are in love with the man you imagine he could become.`,
        `You mistake potential for partnership. You stay for the story in your head, not the reality in your bed.`,
        `But potential without purpose is poison. A man may whisper secrets, share dreams, even lean on you in weakness. But if he never anchors you in his vision, then he has not chosen you. He has only entertained you.`,
        `Fantasy is seductive because it delays accountability. As long as you dream about who he might be, you never have to face who he is.`,
        `✦ Validation: The High of Being Wanted`,
        `Attention is addictive. The late-night calls. The compliments. The fire in his eyes when he reaches for you.`,
        `It can feel like a crown, but it is counterfeit. Validation feeds your ego but starves your soul.`,
        `Because here is the truth: a man can want your body, depend on your comfort, even admire your strength, and still never crown you.`,
        `A man is loyal to one thing only: his vision. If you are not seated in that vision, you are not chosen. You are simply convenient.`,
        `✦ Crumbs: The Illusion of Enough`,
        `The harem survives on crumbs.`,
        `A text here. A touch there. A promise he never fulfills. You tell yourself it is better than nothing. But queens were not born to eat scraps.`,
        `Crumbs keep you docile. They trick you into believing you are satisfied when in reality you are starving.`,
        `He may share his secrets, his time, even his body. But if he will not bring you into his throne, then every crumb is deception.`,
        `And hear this: a man does not give his throne away. It is his God-given mandate. But if he is a true king, he does not sit there alone. To share the throne means he opens his vision to you, makes you partner in his assignment, and seats you beside him as queen.`,
        `Anything less is not covenant. It is convenience.`,
        `The throne does not serve crumbs. The throne demands covenant. And until you demand more, you will keep mistaking leftovers for love.`,
        `✦ The Awakening`,
        `So what keeps you in the bed?`,
        `Wounds you haven't healed.`,
        `Fantasies you haven't released.`,
        `Validation you keep chasing.`,
        `Crumbs you keep accepting.`,
        `But beloved, once you see it for what it is, you cannot stay.`,
        `The mattress becomes too small for your crown. The same bed that once felt like power now feels like prison. And when the prison is exposed, the only option left is freedom.`,
        `🔥 Chapter Close`,
        `Do not let trauma hold you. Do not let fantasy blind you. Do not let validation addict you. Do not let crumbs starve you.`,

      subtitle: "The Crown That Can't Be Earned in Bed",
      epigraph: 'Understanding the difference between sexual access and emotional reign',
      content: [
        `The bed is the easiest place to enter.`,
        `But the crown is the hardest to obtain.`,
        `Because the crown is not awarded to the woman who performs the best in the night: it is given to the woman who reigns with him in the day.`,
        `Sex can grant access to his body.`,
        `But only vision will grant access to his throne.`,
        `✦ The Illusion of Sexual Access`,
        `So many women confuse intimacy with authority.`,
        `They believe that because they are the one he touches, they are the one he will trust.`,
        `But touch does not equal trust.`,
        `A man may open his bed to many.`,
        `But he opens his throne to only one.`,
        `The crown is not a prize for performance.`,
        `It is a seat for purpose.`,
        `✦ The Weight of Emotional Reign`,
        `To reign beside him is not about passion: it is about partnership.`,
        `It requires clarity, responsibility, and the courage to be seen not just in private but in public.`,
        `Because the moment he seats you beside him in the open, he can no longer rotate you in the shadows.`,
        `Once you are crowned in the light, you cannot be hidden in the dark.`,
        `That is why most men will enjoy you behind closed doors, but only a king has the courage to honor you before the world.`,
        `A man may share his secrets at night, but unless he builds with you in the day, you are not crowned.`,
        `Desire without devotion will always leave you empty.`,
        `Because men can crave many, but they covenant with only one.`,
        `✦ The Difference Between Bed and Throne`,
        `The bed is where he proves his appetite.`,
        `The throne is where he proves his assignment.`,
        `The bed tests your ability to please him.`,
        `The throne tests your ability to reign with him.`,
        `And here is the truth: no matter how beautiful, loyal, or talented you are, you cannot earn the crown in the sheets.`,
        `Because the crown is not secured by seduction.`,
        `It is confirmed by vision.`,
        `Anchored in purpose.`,
        `Sealed through alignment.`,
        `✦ Appetite vs Discipline`,
        `Appetite is endless.`,
        `No matter how much you give him; he will always want more.`,
        `You can make yourself prettier, thinner, curvier, more "exciting" in bed, and it will never be enough.`,
        `Because appetite cannot be satisfied by indulgence.`,
        `It only grows hungrier.`,
        `This is why so many women deceive themselves into thinking:`,
        `"If I am hot enough, wild enough, submissive enough, I can tame him."`,
        `But his appetite is not tamed by sex.`,
        `It is disciplined by vision.`,
        `A man without vision will always overuse the bed.`,
        `He will reach for more bodies, more fantasies, more women, because appetite has no anchor.`,
        `But a man who has risen to his assignment learns to discipline himself.`,
        `Vision demands focus.`,
        `Assignment requires covenant.`,
        `Purpose calls him to order.`,
        `And that is why only a man with vision can truly crown a woman.`,
        `Because without purpose, he can give you passion, but he cannot give you reign.`,
        `✦ The Crown Is Not For Sale`,
        `From the time we are young, women are told:`,
        `"If you do enough, he will stay."`,
        `Cook his meals. Clean his house. Bear his children. Serve his needs. Become his fantasy in bed.`,
        `Culture whispers:`,
        `"If you fill his belly and satisfy his body, he won't wander."`,
        `But appetite is never faithful.`,
        `You can cook his favorite meal every night and he will still cheat. You can give him children, and he will still leave. You can bend your body into every shape of beauty, and it will never secure your crown.`,
        `Because the crown is not bought with service.`,
        `It is not won by sacrifice.`,
        `A man is not loyal to beauty. Not loyal to kindness. Not even to consistency.`,
        `He is loyal to vision.`,
        `And if his vision does not require your presence, then all your labor will only feed his appetite not secure your place.`,
        `That is why the crown is not for sale.`,
        `It cannot be purchased with your womb, your hands, your body, or your loyalty.`,
        `It can only be recognized through alignment with purpose.`,
        `✦ The Queen's Revelation`,
        `The crown that cannot be earned in bed is the crown already prepared for you by heaven.`,
        `It does not depend on being the most desired, but on being the most aligned.`,
        `It does not depend on pleasing him in the night, but on standing beside him in the kingdom.`,
        `Because the truth is this: queens are not chosen through competition: they are revealed through alignment.`,
        `Your place beside him is not won by beauty, performance, or sacrifice.`,
        `It is revealed when your purpose and his vision collide.`,
        `The crown does not belong to the one who gives the most or tries the hardest.`,
        `It belongs to the one already written into his destiny.`,
        `When his assignment rises, it will recognize your presence.`,
        `When his throne is established, it will demand your seat.`,
        `This is why you must never waste your life fighting for a seat in the bed.`,
        `The real seat has already been marked in the throne room of purpose.`,
        `And when alignment comes, it will not feel like performance.`,
        `It will feel like recognition.`,
        `So stop exhausting yourself trying to earn loyalty with your body, your kindness, or your sacrifice.`,
        `A man is not loyal to appetite. He is loyal to vision.`,
        `And when his vision demands your presence, nothing can replace you.`,
        `The crown is not given to the woman who serves his appetite.`,
        `It is inherited by the woman whose purpose aligns with his assignment.`,
        `That is why no one else can take your place.`,
        `No matter how crowded the bed may be, the throne has only one seat for the queen destined to reign with him.`,
        `🔥 Chapter Close`,
        `Beloved, the crown is not a reward for sex it is a recognition of sovereignty.`,
        `It cannot be given through flattery, fantasy, or flesh. It can only be bestowed through covenant, vision, purpose, and alignment.`,
        `Because the crown that can't be earned in bed was never meant to be earned. It was meant to be inherited.`,

      epigraph: 'Frequency. Depth. Purpose. Why momentary pleasure always fades',
      content: [
        `He swore in the night that you were unforgettable.`,
        `He whispered in your ear that no one else made him feel this way.`,
        `And you believed him.`,
        `But by morning, his promises are as empty as the sheets he leaves behind.`,
        `Because the truth is this: lust burns bright, but it always burns out.`,
        `✦ Pleasure Without Purpose Has No Memory`,
        `Sex without covenant feels like fire in the moment.`,
        `But fire without an altar always dies into smoke.`,
        `It lights up the sky like fireworks.`,
        `But once the noise is gone, all that is left is silence and ashes.`,
        `The body can be electrified, but the soul remains untouched.`,
        `The flesh can climax, but the spirit stays empty.`,
        `That is why the night feels unforgettable, but the morning feels disposable.`,
        `Frequency can train his body to want you, but it cannot convince his soul to crown you.`,
        `Depth in bed is not the same as depth in destiny.`,
        `Passion can ignite a night.`,
        `But only purpose can build a lifetime.`,
        `This is why he forgets them by morning: appetite cannot remember what vision never recognized.`,
        `✦ Why Desire Fades After the Act`,
        `Men chase novelty because appetite thrives on variety.`,
        `The more he indulges, the less weight it carries.`,
        `What feels powerful at midnight becomes ordinary at dawn.`,
        `The lie says: If I give him more, he will give me more.`,
        `But appetite does not bargain. Appetite only consumes.`,
        `You can be wild enough to thrill him. Gentle enough to calm him. Submissive enough to please him.`,
        `And still be forgotten by sunrise.`,
        `Because sex alone was never designed to hold a man.`,
        `Only vision, purpose, and alignment anchor loyalty.`,
        `✦ The Mattress of Confusion`,
        `Here is the trap: the mattress of confusion.`,
        `It feels like intimacy, but it is only activity.`,
        `It looks like connection, but it is just rotation.`,
        `It feels like power, but it leaves you powerless.`,
        `On this mattress, women confuse frequency with favor.`,
        `They mistake sweat for covenant.`,
        `They confuse pleasure with position.`,
        `But the mattress of confusion has one law: everybody leaves empty.`,
        `He leaves empty because he never finds his queen.`,
        `She leaves empty because she gave herself hoping to be remembered but wakes up erased.`,
        `Beloved, the mattress of confusion is not where queens are crowned.`,
        `It is where they are deceived.`,
        `✦ The Juicy Prophetic Truth`,
        `Here is the revelation: the bed without covenant is not intimacy, it is amnesia.`,
        `The very act that feels like union becomes the thing that erases you from his spirit.`,
        `He does not remember because he never intended to.`,
        `If he can forget you after touching you, it means he never saw you as throne-worthy before touching you.`,
        `And no amount of frequency or fantasy can change that.`,
        `✦ The Call to Queens`,
        `Stop trading your body for the false hope of permanence. Stop giving nights to men who cannot give you a future. Stop auditioning for the role of queen on the mattress of confusion.`,
        `Because you were never called to be his midnight escape. You were called to be his daylight crown.`,
        `🔥 Chapter Close`,
        `Beloved, he forgets them by morning because pleasure fades, but purpose endures. He forgets them by morning because lust excites, but only alignment sustains. He forgets them by morning because the bed is momentary, but the throne is eternal.`,
        `So hear me: do not lie on the mattress of confusion. Do not let your crown sink beneath his sheets.`,
        `If you are already on that mattress, treat this as your 911 call, your trumpet blast, your emergency exit.`,
        `Get up. Get out. And rise into your throne.`,
        `Because queens are not meant to be forgotten. Queens are not meant to compete for memory. Queens are meant to be enthroned: remembered, honored, revealed. 👑`,

        `A throne-worthy woman is not unforgettable because of what she does.`,
        `She is unforgettable because of who she is.`,
        `If performance could crown you, every good cook and bedroom gymnast would be a queen.`,
        `But the throne is not for performers.`,
        `It is for daughters of destiny.`,
        `✦ Presence Over Performance`,
        `Throne-worthy women don't audition for roles in a man's play.`,
        `They don't sing, dance, and juggle hoping for applause.`,
        `They know their presence is power and presence needs no performance.`,
        `Performance begs: Pick me, keep me, don't forget me.`,
        `Presence declares: I am already crowned. Recognize me, or step aside.`,
        `Because anybody can be rotated in bed.`,
        `Only a queen carries presence that cannot be recycled, replaced, or ignored.`,
        `A maid can clean his house.`,
        `A chef can cook his food.`,
        `A fling can thrill his body.`,
        `But only a queen can command his destiny.`,
        `Presence is not doing more.`,
        `Presence is being undeniable.`,
        `That's why a throne-worthy woman doesn't compete she completes the assignment.`,
        `✦ She Cannot Be Replicated`,
        `Counterfeits are copycats: they'll snatch your hairstyle, your slang, even your Pinterest board if they could.`,
        `But imitation runs out of ink when it tries to copy essence.`,
        `Her essence is not cosmetic: it is cosmic.`,

        `Sorry sis the app isn't available, and heaven never built a knockoff version.`,
        `✦ The Making Process`,
        `Do not think throne-worthy women are stitched together by a man's approval.`,
        `They are sculpted by the hand of God Himself.`,
        `Every heartbreak that should have broken her became a hammer in God's grip, shaping her steel.`,
        `Every betrayal that should have ended her became blueprint ink in His hand, drafting her destiny.`,
        `Every delay that mocked her became God's divine incubation, preparing her crown in silence.`,
        `It was never heartbreak alone.`,
        `Heartbreak without God is just destruction.`,
        `But heartbreak in His hands becomes construction.`,
        `That's why she is not cracked; she is crafted.`,
        `Not delayed, but divinely timed.`,
        `Not broken, but built.`,

        `Sovereign love is not needy; it is noble. It has borders sacred borders.`,
        `No access without order. No intimacy without integrity. No titles without tasks. No "us" without vision.`,
        `If your standards feel like "too much," remember castles are not built without walls. What you call a boundary, destiny calls breathable air.`,

    `The Crowded Bed & The Empty Throne`,
    `✦ 1. The Seal`,
    `Beloved, this book does not end with theory. It ends with a mirror. It names the crowded bed for what it is: not intimacy, but illusion. Not covenant, but counterfeits with cologne. It unmasks appetite disguised as affection, rotation dressed up as romance, silence masquerading as mystery. Perfume can hide sweat, but it cannot cover disorder.`,
    `And yet, the throne has been calling all along. The throne is order where chaos once slept. The throne is covenant where appetite once ruled. The throne is not a mattress of compromise, but a seat of government. It is the place where dignity is decreed, where peace governs like policy, and where destiny refuses audition.`,
    `This is the royal standard: Queens do not compete. Peace is proof. Solitude is strategy. Covenant outranks appetite. And she, the sovereign woman, does not sit where culture rotates her, but where heaven seats her.`,
    `✦ 2. The Call`,
    `Now the word turns from page to pulse. It is not enough to underline these truths. You must embody them. Shut the doors of crowded beds. Refuse the lie of being "chosen." Unsubscribe from secrecy, silence, and the harem economy. Delete the mattress of confusion from your memory like expired software. You were never built to audition, never designed for rotation, never called to be crumbs on anyone's table.`,
    `Your crown is covenant. Your presence is policy. Your silence is not weakness, it is government. Your throne is not pending approval; it is waiting for recognition. If purpose is unknown, abuse is inevitable. And so it is with the bed, it abuses what it cannot define. But the throne defines. The throne orders. The throne gives love its law and vision its vocabulary. Without vision, people perish; without government, love collapses. Appetite cannot carry you. Only assignment can.`,
    `So here is the call: Rise. Build. Govern. Let your "no" be boundary lines and your "yes" be royal decrees. Let your solitude become strategy, not sentence. Let your peace become evidence, not excuse. And let your life itself be the loudest sermon that you are already enthroned within.`,
    `✦ 3. The Charge`,
    `I refuse the mattress of confusion; I rise into the architecture of peace. I am not an accessory to appetite; I am a sovereign seat of covenant. I will not compete for a counterfeit crown. Queens do not compete. I reject the lie of being chosen without co-regency; I am not a favorite slave. I will not barter purpose for proximity, my throne for attention, or my crown for convenience. I choose covenant over appetite, assignment over desire, evidence over excuses. I guard my peace as policy, my solitude as strategy, and my standard as scripture. I sit where heaven seats me. Not where rotation invites me. I am not forgotten, forsaken, or for sale. My crown is not on clearance. I am throne-worthy, destiny-aligned, sovereign, sealed.`,
    `Holy humor for the journey: if he still texts "wyd?" at 2 a.m., that's not pursuit that's probation. And probation never comes with a crown. 😂`,
    `✦ 4. The Crown`,
    `And so the final word is this: The crowded bed is a counterfeit throne. The empty throne is your inheritance. Look into it and see sovereignty staring back not lack, not delay, not weakness, but government rising.`,
    `No woman can manipulate a throne into existence. Any formula sold on the market for that is false science. Rebuke the lie. 🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏽‍♂️`,
    `The throne awaits. You are called to rise. And when you do, history itself will adjust its records, because heaven already carved your name into the crown. 👑`,
